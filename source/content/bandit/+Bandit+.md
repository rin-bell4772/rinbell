# A simple explanation of the Bandit game:
---
The bandit game is a game created by OverTheWire which tests your knowledge on command-line interface commands and navigation! If you want to learn about command-line commands by getting your hands messy (not really), then I think this is a perfect game for you!

You ssh into one of overthewire's servers `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` and try and find the password hidden somewhere in the file system.

## Personal Notes on Bandit

Personally, I am using this to learn about how I can use command-line commands in advanced applications! As a computer science student, I am fairly comfortable with the command line. I also use a Linux distribution as my daily-driver operating system, so I hope I can consider myself familiar with it.
