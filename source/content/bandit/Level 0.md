This is the introductory level of Bandit!

The purpose of this level seems to be to teach you about `ssh`! 

You are given:
- username: `bandit0`
- password: `bandit0`
- host name: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- port number: `2220`

Once you successfully `ssh` in, then you have completed level 0!

> This solution is very short! Just open any terminal and type the following command:
> ```zsh
> ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
> ```
