## +
Files marked with `+` are typically the "home" or "main" page of a folder! They will typically contain a description of the folder and give you an idea about what I'm writing about!

## notes
The notes folder will contain notes on things (duh!). If enough notes on a certain subject are made, they might be moved to another dedicated folder. 

## articles
The article folder will contain articles! Things like opinions and one-page instructions and stuff~
