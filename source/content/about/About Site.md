This site is hosted on github pages and is built off of Quartz, a tool that allows me to create Obsidian formatted sites for free!

# Purpose
---
The purpose of this site is not really strictly defined. I mostly wanted a website where I can share information, blog about things, write personal articles and the like. 

To my understanding, teaching is one of the best ways to learn and test your knowledge, so why don't I try teaching to the world! 

This site will mostly be on the topics of **Computer Science** and **Cybersecurity**, however there may be some pages/articles on other things.

I will try and make the things I write understandable by anyone, but there are no guarantees.
